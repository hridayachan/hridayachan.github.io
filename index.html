            <h1 class="cursive">Release the Kraken</h1>
            <p>No, seriously - let all the Kraken go because panicking is not an option - just take a deep breath or two and ask yourself these three basic questions:</p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>- What is essential for my wellbeing right now? </li>
                <li>- What kind of space and tools do I need to survive?</li>
                <li>- What are my capabilities and limits?</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The apocalypse might just be the spiritual revolution society desperately wants but we don't need more heroes or tools - we actually need more storytellers. The ones that can save us time and energy digesting new paradigms. The ones that help us realize that potential is nothing without a story to believe in. The ones who want to guide the users, not their experiences.</p>

            <label>STEP 2</label>
            <h1 class="cursive">Find your Crew</h1>
            <p>Regardless if it's people or nutrients, you will need a large supply of both to have enough energy to keep finding what keeps you going. A healthy philosophy means you're finally juicing the right kind of experiences out of life's chaos and drinking joyful messages from everywhere, preferably in the company of good friends.</p>

            <p>Loss of power can be real problem through the apocalypse, so make sure the electric company crew number is accessible at all times, that you have a few alternative sources of heat and more importantly, that you surround yourself with people who are aware of their own limitations and the limitations of those around them, who genuinely care to help each other level up their skills and resilience. That kind of shit makes a good crew. It's empathy driven collaboration.</p>

            <p>What story are you telling yourself and those around you? Are you being completely honest about your limitations - because those who "do what has to be done" are probably sucking at doing it anyway. Conjuring a clear list of requirements to achieve decent deliverables should be number one priority. Everything else is secondary, including knowing everyone's favorite band. Mine is Queen btw.</p>

            <p>And so, as we grow older and wiser so does the crew that keep us thriving. To stay where we don't belong can jeopardize the unique and wondrous spirits we have been blessed with to survive the apocalypse. Let go immediately of things that don't resonate and invest your huge fortune of nows where it will truly bring karmic returns.</p>

            <h1 class="cursive">Save your Energy</h1>
            <p>Zombieland rule number one is Cardio. But that's a Hollywood thing. The truth is that the slower we do things, the less likely it is to make mistakes - that's why mother Nature takes her time yet everything is accomplished. Rushing is a thing of the 80's - and God knows what kind of drugs everyone was taking back then to keep up.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the age of lack of focus and endless options - the primary source of energy waste. When the energy is wasted, so is the time to develop new skills and the capability of being fully present.</p>

            <p>The apocalypse is a great time to level up spiritually and find safety in the present moment at all times. In there, every choice is divinely aligned with our inner compass and we finally realize that happiness is not hiding behind 'tomorrow' but fully displayed in our capacity to embrace and honor 'today'.</p>

            <p>Remember, opinions are the real zombies in the coming apocalypse.</p>

            <label>STEP 4</label>
            <h1 class="cursive">Invest in SkillCoin<sup class="fas fa-trademark"></sup></h1>
            <p>Specialization is for insects. An institution is like a hive. It creates extrinsic purpose like high hanging fruits that are meant to be chased with a certain degree of blind obedience. But wait, people are more than insects. Each one is a priceless jewel available only for a limited time on top of this ancient crust we call home. Life is crafted, not fabricated and each individual has a special set of skills to offer that take drive, time and energy to fully develop. The kind of coins anyone should be investing in at this point should be:</p>

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>- Ability to Research and Curate Knowledge</li>
                <li>- Create and Preserve Goods</li>
                <li>- Provide and Exchange Services</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Surrounding ourselves with people who have no interest supporting the skills we are inclined to work on is a waste of time and an incredibly dangerous thing to do through the incoming apocalypse. We need to always be a step ahead of everything that is trying to kill our spirit. And without spirit we won't thrive, we'll merely survive.</p>
